    <h2>Now, you may be thinking? Why believe us? Well:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My IQ is 163. For those of you unfamiliar with IQ, this means I have "genius-level" intelligence. I also have synaesthesia, and absolute pitch. Things as diverse as math, music, and art come naturally to me and I get straight A's without studying much at all. I also am able to understand music at a deeper level than most people. While most people my age spend their free time listening to mainstream music, I spend my free time listening to works such as Beethoven's 9th Symphony, Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Mozart's Eine Kleine Nacht Musik, Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2, and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. All this and I'm still in high school. Ask me anything.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>You sound like you have small iq, i know this because i have 210 iq. How do i know this? Well i made myself an iq test, than I gave it out to all my classmates and teachers and they all scored 120 iq. Dont believe me? Well give me your iq test, I bet i can solve it so fast i would break it! When my parents found out my iq gift, they werent surprised. They said I started to speak when I was only 1 year old. I even remember how I was born. Whenever somebody talks to me, my brain already is 1000 times ahead and predicts what will people say so I know everything before we even speak SO I dont even need to speak to people. Because ordinary people are so stupid, I like to be alone. usually I solve difficult mathematical problems because if I dont keep my brain bussy it starts to think about the universe, quantum mechanics and how it all works, than I have to write it all down and publish a paper on it. This gets boring after some time so I start thinking about the laws of physics and why was I gifted with such a high iq. Well there is a law that states that the universe is infinite and there is infinite possibility, that means that in some universe you might be smart and have a 140 iq but I know there is no universe where I have less than 200 iq because I have mastered my brain. I can control every function of my body. So i can control every atom that links me and my other self in other universes and I know they link back to me and that means we all have an iq of 20000000 MINIMUM. So by linking my brain cells with other Me in other dimensions we create a super human computer and We can calculate everything that happens everywhere and by my calculations your iq is 80. Thats why you are stupid.</li>
